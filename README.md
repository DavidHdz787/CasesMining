Additional details:

The scripts are free to use for everyone who wants to use it in their own code, remember that it is necessary install the packages that appear at the beggining of every script for the correct functioning. The "language recognition" scripts are designed for the telegram json structure and for my own use, so be free to redesign it for your purpose, keep it in mind.
